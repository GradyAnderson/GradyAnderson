        <h2>Dominion Energy</h2>
            <p>In the summer before my sophomore year in high school I had the tremendous opportunity to intern at Dominion Energy. Myself and 5 others were temporarily hired to mainly perform safety checks on every employee in all of their Richmond corporate offices. After we finished the safety checks in the first 2 weeks I helped the I.T. department with help desk tickets, mainly hardware related. As well as working on help desk tickets I helped them flash new laptops with a company wide version of Windows, and clean retired laptops using a kill disk.</p>

        <h2>Internship</h2>
            <h2>Business Intelligence/Analytics</h2>
            <p>Being my first department in the MaxxPower rotational work I wasn’t sure what I’d be challenged with. My role being a Data Engineer I was the person who implemented Google Analytics into the Company website as well as manage the websites traffic. Along with being the Data Engineer I was tasked with helping the Data Analyst with any problems they ran into while making dashboards in Google Data Studio. During this rotation I became familiar with Google Analytics and Google Data Studio so that not only I could complete my task, but as well as help the others in my group.</p>

            <h2>System/App Development</h2>
            <p>My second rotation I was assigned to the Sys/App Development department, my individual role was Scrum Master/Product Owner. Tasked with a full website overhaul of the company website I decided to plan the 2 week sprint on Trello so that the entire team could have access to each days workload. Sadly enough we did not get to the point that I had intended us to be at for the finish of the project, but we did rebuild the website to make it more professional. I did not plan for any days off when planning the 2 week sprint, and in the second week we had multiple days off that I didn’t account for. That being said the project was still complete and on time. Even with the setbacks this rotation was easily my favorite, being able to experience an Agile inspired 2 week sprint and working as a machine and not as individual people felt amazing to lead/be a part of.</p>

            <h2>Information Security</h2>
            <p>My third and final department being Information Security I knew that It was going to be a challenge because the other 2 groups that went before were unable to complete the project at hand. In the position of System Administrator and tasked with implementing a password management system my biggest role was to decide what each department was able to see in the password management system. Choosing to implement a fully built password management system rather than build one I feel was the correct decision considering the technical skill in my group and the goals of the project. Another challenge was to find a password management system for free, in the end we decided on Dashlane because it was easy to use, free of cost, and fit the needs of the company. </p>

        <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <p>In middle school I was accepted into a leadership program where I spent 2-3 days a week learning of some of the most impactful leaders in history. While most of my time in the program was spent observing leaders in history I had to opportunity to lead a project every semester to actually practice my leadership skills. I have carried a majority of what I learned in the leadership academy to my work in the internship by: persevering as a team through challenges, listening to my group members, and showing initiative when someone needs help in my team.</p>

        <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
            <p>Starting in 6th grade and completing my first desktop in the winter of 7th grade I fell in love with computers. Just about once a year since 7th grade I had done a yearly upgrade of my original gaming rig. Now, 4 years later, I have officially replaced every original part about twice. Recently purchasing a gaming laptop and from my work at Dominion Energy I have found an interest in laptop hardware as well.</p>

        <h2>Football</h2>
            <p> Having the opportunity to play Junior Varsity football for my freshman year at Hopewell High School was life changing. It truly lead to the work ethic I have today in my everyday life. The first 3 games I had no play time, I wasn’t mad at my coaches I simply worked harder for the playtime. Everyday at practice I’d only better myself, I’d stay late to work out after 3 games out, hard work, and learning the plays during practice I played the rest of the season as a starting left guard.</p>
