    <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
        <p>My journey into computer science truly started when i was accepted to CodeRVA Regional High School, but ever since sixth grade I have loved computers. Before being accepted into CodeRVA I had the option to be enrolled in a leadership academy where I was able to practice public speaking, and learn what it meant to be a leader/follower. After being accepted to CodeRVA I was selected to intern for the summer at Dominion Energy's corporate office in Richmond. Now in my junior year of high school I’m starting my journey to be a lifelong learner.</p>

    <h2>Describing Myself</h2>
        <p>I’d consider myself a down to earth guy who values family and his work ethic. When I was 13 years old I started to work with my father. What I learned while working under him in carpentry truly changed my life for the best. Understanding how to use your hands to build and mold things into a finished product I took with me everywhere in life. From playing video games, building computers, and leading groups of people I took my work ethic with me.
