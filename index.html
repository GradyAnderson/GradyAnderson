    <h2>Hello, I'm Grady Anderson.</h2>
        <p>While new to the Computer Science field and still deciding as what to do with my career path I am nothing but eager to learn. </p><br></br>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Being only in high school I interned at Dominion Energy for a summer performing safety checks as well as working with their I.T. department. In school I have worked with the following: HTML, CSS, and Python with turtle. During this internship with Maxx Potential I have been able to work with and understand, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, and Google Sheets. Agile is a newer term to me but I have been able to work on a PBL project in my sophomore year, as well as be the Scrum Master for a website overhaul we did during the internship. </p><br></br>
    <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>While in middle school I was in a leadership academy program at my middle school, there I had a class every day where we discussed what leadership was and how we can lead. While there I attended many conferences where leaders spoke and told stories of their feats in leadership. Also, in my freshman year of high school I play on Junior Varsity football as a left guard. Through my experience there I learned how to work seamlessly with others to make just the right plays.<br></br>
    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Raised in Richmond and later moving around Virginia, it has been amazing to be able to come back to my city roots while attending CodeRVA Regional High School. Since middle school I have loved to work on my personal computer. Just about once a year I do some sort of upgrade to it, whether a new graphics card, processor, or just a new case. While working at Dominion I had the opportunity to work on laptops in my time there I worked on roughly 20 laptops doing some sort of hardware work. Not only did I work with hardware while I was there, I also learned how to fully clean laptops and set up laptops with a company boot drive.</p><br></br>
    <h2>Business Intelligence</h2>
        <p>When I was in the Business Intelligence department my role was “Data Engineer”. My job was fairly simple to understand so I was able to work quickly on my task to find ways to attain pertinent data for the company. My team and I decided to choose Google Analytics and Google Data Studio to find and aggregate the data we came across. In the end we finished both projects assigned to us on time.</p><br></br>
    <h2>System/App Development</h2>
        <p>This department was responsible for the “Maxx Power” website overhaul for our project. My role being Scrum Master/ Product Owner I watched over two Web Developers, UI/UX Designer, and a QA Specialist. This was the first group where I was truly put into a leadership role, I have learned that planning seems to be my only hindering weakness. The website overhaul was still completed but not to the extent that I wanted it to be. But we still worked together in the end to finish the project.</p><br></br>
    <h2>Information Security</h2>
        <p>Finishing the internship off in this group I hope to fully deliver a complete project and maybe even early. My individual role being System Administrator I hold the responsibility to keep systems up and running and up to date. Our project for this rotation is to implement a password management system for all employees. We have decided to use a prebuilt password management system such as “Last Pass” but we have been challenged with finding a “cost efficient” (free) piece of software.</p><br></br>
